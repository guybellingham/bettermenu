==========
OO Javascript MVC Navigation Menu
This is an industrial strength Menu Bar based upon Javascript objects for the Model, View and Controller. 
The model has NO behavior and can be exported to and imported from JSON data. 
I developed this menubar in my own time and using my own resources.  
The example 'model' is derived from the Con-way internal Tabigator but the code is entirely new and in no way derived or inspired by their code. 

TODO:
1. Add security and a Permissions model and controller, so that a 'user' can be restricted from seeing MenuItems that they should not see. 
2. Add fancy styles and animations.
